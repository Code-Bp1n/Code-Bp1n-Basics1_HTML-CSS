            <header><h1>Major Eras of Human History</h1></header><hr>
             <p>The study of <em>Human History</em> is often organized into major eras, each defined by transformative technological, social, and cultural developments. 
                These periods—Prehistoric, Ancient, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Modern—provide a framework for understanding humanity’s evolution across millions of years.
                 Grounded in archaeological and historical evidence, this timeline highlights key milestones while acknowledging regional variations and the limitations of Eurocentric periodization. 
                 The following overview aims to present these eras concisely, balancing scholarly precision with accessibility.</p>

            <h2>1. Prehistoric Era (c. 3.3 million years ago–c. 3300 BCE)</h2>

                 <p><em>Definition:</em>Encompasses human and hominin activity before written records, starting with the earliest stone tools. 
                    This era is studied through archaeological finds like tools, fossils, and art.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Subdivisions and Key Developments :</h4>
                       <ul>
                          <li>Paleolithic (Old Stone Age, c. 3.3 million–10,000 BCE)</li>
                             <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                             <ul>
                                <li>Earliest tools: Lomekwian stone tools (Kenya, 3.3 million years ago), attributed to early hominins (e.g., Australopithecus).</li>
                                <li>Oldowan tools (2.6 million–1.7 million years ago), found in Gona, Ethiopia, used by Homo habilis for cutting and scraping.</li>   
                                <li>Acheulean handaxes (1.76 million–100,000 years ago), associated with Homo erectus, found across Africa, Europe, and Asia.</li>
                                <li>Control of fire: Evidence at Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa (c. 1 million years ago), and Qesem Cave (c. 400,000 years ago).</li>
                                <li>Upper Paleolithic (c. 50,000–10,000 BCE): Emergence of Homo sapiens, with complex tools (e.g., blades, burins) and art (e.g., Lascaux Cave paintings, France, c. 17,000 BCE).</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p>b.) Population Data: Estimated global population of Homo sapiens by 10,000 BCE: ~1–10 million (based on genetic studies and archaeological site density).</p>
                             <p>c.) Social Structure: Small, mobile hunter-gatherer bands (20–50 individuals), egalitarian, with evidence of trade (e.g., obsidian tools found 100+ km from source).</p>
                              <p>d.) Key Sites: Blombos Cave, South Africa (engraved ochre, c. 75,000 BCE); Chauvet Cave, France (art, c. 30,000 BCE).</p>

                            <li>Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age, c. 10,000–6000 BCE)</li>
                               <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Transition post-Last Glacial Maximum (c. 20,000–10,000 BCE).</li>
                                <li>Microlith tools (e.g., Star Carr, England, c. 8500 BCE) for hunting and fishing.</li>
                                <li>Early sedentism: Natufian culture (Levant, c. 12,500–9500 BCE) with proto-agriculture.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>b.) Key Developments: Domestication of dogs (e.g., Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany, c. 14,700 BCE).</p>
                              <p>c.) Population Data: Global population likely doubled to ~5–20 million due to resource stability.</p>

                            <li>Neolithic (New Stone Age, c. 10,000–3300 BCE)</li>
                               <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Neolithic Revolution: Independent origins of agriculture in Fertile Crescent (c. 10,000 BCE, wheat, barley), China (c. 7000 BCE, rice, millet), Mesoamerica (c. 6000 BCE, maize), and Andes (c. 5000 BCE, potatoes).</li>
                                <li>Göbekli Tepe, Turkey (c. 9600–7000 BCE): Early monumental architecture, predating agriculture.</li>

                                    </figure>
                                <li>Çatalhöyük, Turkey (c. 7100–5700 BCE): Proto-urban settlement with ~5,000–10,000 residents.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>b.) Key Developments: Pottery (e.g., Jomon culture, Japan, c. 10,000 BCE), weaving, and permanent settlements.</p>
                              <p>c.) Population Data: Global population grew to ~50 million by 3300 BCE due to agricultural surplus.</p>
                              <p>* Critique: The term “Prehistoric” implies a lack of complexity, yet Göbekli Tepe and other sites show sophisticated social organization. Regional variations (e.g., African pastoralism vs. Mesoamerican horticulture) challenge universal timelines.</p>
