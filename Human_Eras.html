            <header><h1>Major Eras of Human History</h1></header><hr>
             <p>The study of <em>Human History</em> is often organized into major eras, each defined by transformative technological, social, and cultural developments. 
                These periods—Prehistoric, Ancient, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Modern—provide a framework for understanding humanity’s evolution across millions of years.
                 Grounded in archaeological and historical evidence, this timeline highlights key milestones while acknowledging regional variations and the limitations of Eurocentric periodization. 
                 The following overview aims to present these eras concisely, balancing scholarly precision with accessibility.</p>
             
                 <hr><p>Listed below :-</p><hr>
            <h2>1. Prehistoric Era (c. 3.3 million years ago–c. 3300 BCE)</h2>

                              <p>c.) Population Data: Global population grew to ~50 million by 3300 BCE due to agricultural surplus.</p>
                              <p><strong>* Critique: The term “Prehistoric” implies a lack of complexity, yet Göbekli Tepe and other sites show sophisticated social organization. Regional variations (e.g., African pastoralism vs. Mesoamerican horticulture) challenge universal timelines.</strong></p>
