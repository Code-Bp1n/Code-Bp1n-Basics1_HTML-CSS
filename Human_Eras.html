            <header><h1>Major Eras of Human History</h1></header><hr>
             <p>The study of <em>Human History</em> is often organized into major eras, each defined by transformative technological, social, and cultural developments. 
                These periods—Prehistoric, Ancient, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Modern—provide a framework for understanding humanity's evolution across millions of years.
                 Grounded in archaeological and historical evidence, this timeline highlights key milestones while acknowledging regional variations and the limitations of Eurocentric periodization. 
                 The following overview aims to present these eras concisely, balancing scholarly precision with accessibility.</p>
             
                 <hr><p>Listed below :-</p><hr>
            <h2>1. Prehistoric Era (c. 3.3 million years ago-c. 3300 BCE)</h2>

                 <p><em>Definition:</em>The period before written records, spanning from the earliest hominin tool use to the advent of writing in Mesopotamia. 
                   It's characterized by gradual technological and social advancements, studied through fossils, tools, and art.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Subdivisions and Key Developments :</h4>
                       <ul>
                          <li>Paleolithic (Old Stone Age, c. 3.3 million-10,000 BCE)</li>
                             <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                             <ul>
                                <li>Earliest tools: Lomekwian stone tools (Kenya, 3.3 million years ago), attributed to early hominins (e.g., Australopithecus).
                                  Oldowan tools (2.6 million-1.7 million years ago), found in Gona, Ethiopia, used by Homo habilis for cutting and scraping.   
                                 Acheulean handaxes (1.76 million-100,000 years ago), associated with Homo erectus, found across Africa, Europe, and Asia, indicating early migration.</li><br>

                                <li>Fire and Cognition: Evidence of controlled fire at Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa (c. 1 million years ago), suggests cooking, which increased caloric intake and supported brain growth. 
                                  By the Upper Paleolithic (c. 50,000-10,000 BCE), Homo sapiens developed complex behaviors: complex tools (e.g., blades, burins), cave art (e.g., Lascaux, France, c. 17,000 BCE, with 600+ paintings), symbolic objects (e.g., Venus figurines, c. 35,000 BCE), and long-distance trade (e.g., obsidian tools found 100-200 km from sources).</li>
                             </ul>

                             <p>b.) Population Data: Estimated global population of Homo sapiens by 10,000 BCE: ~1-10 million (based on genetic studies and archaeological site density).</p>
                             <p>c.) Social Structure: Small, mobile hunter-gatherer bands (20-50 individuals), egalitarian, with evidence of trade (e.g., obsidian tools found 100+ km from source).</p>
                              <p>d.) Significance: The Paleolithic laid the foundation for human adaptability, with tool use and cultural expression marking cognitive leaps.</p>

                            <li>Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age, c. 10,000-6000 BCE)</li>
                               <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Environmental Shift: The Last Glacial Maximum (c. 20,000-10,000 BCE) ended, warming climates and raising sea levels, which submerged coastal settlements (e.g., Doggerland, North Sea). 
                                  This transition forced adaptation, with microlith tools (e.g., Star Carr, England, c. 8500 BCE) for hunting smaller game and fishing.</li><br>

                                <li>Proto-Agriculture: The Natufian culture (Levant, c. 12,500-9500 BCE) harvested wild grains and built semi-permanent settlements (e.g., Ain Mallaha, with stone structures). 
                                  Evidence of early bread-making (Jordan, c. 14,400 BCE) predates full agriculture.</li>
                              </ul>
              
                              <p>b.) Population Data: Global population likely doubled to ~5-20 million due to resource stability.</p>
                              <p>c.) Significance: The Mesolithic bridged hunter-gatherer lifestyles to sedentary societies, setting the stage for agriculture.</p>

                            <li>Neolithic (New Stone Age, c. 10,000-3300 BCE)</li>
                               <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Neolithic Revolution: Independent agriculture emerged in multiple regions: Fertile Crescent (c. 10,000 BCE, wheat, barley, goats), China (c. 7000 BCE, rice, pigs), Mesoamerica (c. 6000 BCE, maize, beans), and Andes (c. 5000 BCE, potatoes, llamas). 
                                  Göbekli Tepe, Turkey (c. 9600-7000 BCE) with T-shaped pillars, suggests ritual drove early settlement, challenging the idea that agriculture preceded complex societies.</li>

                                <li>Urbanization: Çatalhöyük, Turkey (c. 7100-5700 BCE), housed ~5,000-10,000 people in mudbrick homes, with wall paintings and shrines indicating religious practices. 
                                  Jericho (c. 9000 BCE) had stone walls and a tower, showing defensive architecture.</li><br>

                                <li>Technology: Polished stone tools, pottery (e.g., Jomon, Japan, c. 10,000 BCE), and weaving (e.g., linen in Egypt, c. 5000 BCE).</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>b.) Population Data: Global population grew to ~50 million by 3300 BCE due to agricultural surplus.</p>
                              <p>c.) Significance: The shift to agriculture transformed diets, social hierarchies (e.g., elites in Çatalhöyük), and laid the groundwork for civilizations.</p>
                              <p><strong>* Critique: The “Prehistoric” label can downplay the complexity of societies like Göbekli Tepe. Regional timelines vary (e.g., Australia remained hunter-gatherer longer), and Eurocentric frameworks may overlook African or American developments.</strong></p>

                     <h4>Subdivisions and Key Developments :</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Bronze Age (c. 3300-1200 BCE)</li>
                              <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                               <ul>

                                  <li>Civilizations: Sumer (Uruk, c. 4000 BCE) developed cuneiform, with 5,000+ clay tablets (e.g., Epic of Gilgamesh, c. 2100 BCE).
                                     Egypt's Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE) built the Great Pyramid (c. 2630 BCE, 2.3 million limestone blocks). 
                                     Indus Valley's Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro (c. 2600-1900 BCE) had grid-planned cities and advanced drainage. 
                                    Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE) used oracle bones for divination (~150,000 found).</li><br>

                                  <li>Trade and Technology: Bronze (copper-tin alloy) enabled stronger tools and weapons; wheeled vehicles (Mesopotamia, c. 3500 BCE) and seafaring (e.g., Minoan Crete, c. 2000 BCE) expanded trade (lapis lazuli from Afghanistan to Egypt).</li>

                                </ul>
                              <p>b.) Population Data: Mesopotamia's urban centers (e.g., Ur, c. 2000 BCE) had ~50,000 residents; global population ~100 million by 1200 BCE.</p>
                              <p>c.) Significance: Writing and urbanization enabled complex administration and cultural preservation.</p>
                              
                           <li>Extra-> Collapse of Bronze Age Civilizations (c. 1200-1100 BCE):</li>
                                 <ul>

                                  <li>Details: A systemic collapse affected the Eastern Mediterranean, with Mycenaean Greece, Hittite Empire, and Egyptian New Kingdom declining. 
                                    Evidence includes destroyed cities (e.g., Ugarit, c. 1190 BCE) and reduced trade (e.g., fewer shipwrecks post-1200 BCE). 
                                    Theories include invasions (Sea Peoples, mentioned in Egyptian texts), climate change (drought evidence in tree rings), and internal revolts.</li><br>

                                    <li>Impact: Disrupted trade networks, reduced literacy (e.g., Linear B script lost in Greece), and shifted power to smaller states (e.g., Phoenicia).</li><br>

                                  <li>Significance: The collapse marked a transition to the Iron Age, with new technologies and political structures emerging from the chaos.</li><br>
                                 
                                </ul>
                           <li>Iron Age (c. 1200-500 BCE)</li>
                              <p>a.) Timeline and Evidence:</p>
                                 <ul>

                                  <li>Technology: Iron smelting (Anatolia, c. 1800 BCE) became widespread by 1200 BCE, producing stronger, cheaper tools and weapons.</li>
                                    <br>
                                  <li>Rise of Empires: Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-609 BCE) controlled ~1.4 million km², using iron weapons and siege tactics. 
                                    Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE) in China introduced the “Mandate of Heaven” concept, legitimizing rule.</li><br>
                                
                                  <li>Cultural Advances: Phoenician alphabet (c. 1050 BCE) simplified writing; coinage (Lydia, c. 600 BCE) standardized trade. </li><br>

                                    <li>Greece and Rome: Athenian democracy (c. 508 BCE) allowed ~30,000 male citizens to vote; 
                                      Rome's Republic (509 BCE) evolved into an empire (27 BCE), with roads spanning ~400,000 km.</li>
